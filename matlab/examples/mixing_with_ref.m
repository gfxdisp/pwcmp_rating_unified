% D - NxN matrix with positive integers. D(i,j) = k means that the
%     condition i was better than j in k number of trials. N - is the total
%     number of conditions in all datasets.
% M - NxK matrix with collected ratings, where K is the number of 
% observers. If a rating was not collected for a specific observer or object
% just fill it with NaNs.
% datasets_sizes - 1d array containing number of conditions in each of the 
% datasets.

% Note that D and M must have condition scores in the same order

% The methd returns:
%
% Q - Quality scale. The difference of 1 corresponds to
%     75% of answers selecting one condition over another.
% a, b and c - parameters that indicate scale and noise. c is the relative 
% noisiness of rating versus pairwise comparisons scales, if c > 1 the 
% noise of rating is larger than that of pwc. 
%
% The condition with index 1 (the first row in D) has the score fixed at 
% value 0. Always put "reference" condition at index 1.
